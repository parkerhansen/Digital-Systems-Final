## <a name="what"> What is a Digital Network?
A digital network is the connections between devices that allow for communication between each other. As technology has evolved since the introduction of computers these links can either be physical cables (such as ethernet cables) or wirelessly. The devices are usually referenced to as "nodes" in the context of digital networks.

## <a name="type"> Types of Networks
Even though all networks work based off the same basic principals they are not all the same. Below I am going to explain some commonly used networks.

### <a name="PAN"> Personal Area Network (PAN)
You can observe a personal area networks right in your home. The connections between your computers, printers, smartphones, tablets, and other "smart-devices" that are in your home compromise your own personal area network. These connections can be either physical, through cables, or wirelessly over your home wifi and usually the device connecting them all is a router (example pictured below).

### <a name="LAN"> Local Area Networks (LAN)
Chances are you have heard the term LAN when you are trying to communicate with your internet service provider or trying to connect to wifi. Local area networks connect devices within a limited area. For example these areas could be residences, schools, or offices.
<br><br>The connection between these devices can possibly have a single connection to the internet, within you home this connection happens usually at a modem (example pictured below). While there is also a router, the difference between these two peripherals is that the router connects the devices while the modem connects the devices to the internet service provider.

### <a name="MAN"> Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN)
Going up in scale, a metropolitan area network (MAN) can cover an entire town or city as apposed to a limited specific area with a LAN. Thus it implies that a MAN connects all the networks in a city to a larger network.

### <a name="WAN"> Wide Area Networks (WAN)
Even larger than a metropolitan area network there are wide area networks (WAN). By definition a WAN covers over a large geographical distance or place. Companies, research institutions, and governments frequently use WANs to communicate across the world, and one could consider the internet to be a WAN.

## <a name="clients"> Clients and Servers
The distinction and relationship between clients and servers is an important one.
<br>A **server** is a computer that holds data and content.
<br>A **client** is a different computer that requests the server to view such data and content. The large majority of computers you come in contact with will be clients as you are requesting data and information when you use such computers.
<br>The server and client can be connected wirelessly or be wired together but it is important to keep this relationship in mind as the data you view on your computer came from a server, such as when searching on google.
