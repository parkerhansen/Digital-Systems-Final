## <a name="what"> What Makes a Network?
With the basic idea that a digital network is the connections between devices that allow for communication between each other, all that is required is to connect devices with the ability to exchange data. This connection can be temporary or permanent and wired or wireless. The last necessary component to be able to connect the devices is a **network card** or the equivalent. While most modern devices have them already built in, they are essential to the ability for the device to connect to a network.

## <a name="net"> Network Hubs and Switches
When computers where connected by ethernet cables to create a network, there needed to be a way to connect many computers instead of just two connected by a cable. Thus **hubs** came to be, all ethernet cables would converge at the hub from all computers allowing for information to be shared across all computers.

One downside of hubs is that if a lot of computers are trying to send information/data through the hub it can slow down the data transmission dramatically. To solve this problem a **switch** is put in place. Using the IP connected with where the data is supposed to be sent, the switch directs the data to that exact computer.
